# RETRO-STYLED PLANETARY EXPLORER GAME

## Theme

The theme will be based around Space and space exploration. It will be somewhat educational as it will take place under a 2D replica of our solar system.

## Functionality

The game will be built under a replica of the solar system. You will **drive your vehicle across the galaxy** avoiding/shooting asteroids, and avoiding enemies. It will be in a top-down style, and you will need to complete some kind of challenge against each planet.

## Aesthetic

The aesthetic I am going for will be a mix between two distinct visual vibes.

- **Retro Vector Graphics**: using straight lines to draw crude representations of objects and items. They often use white lines on top of a black background.
  - Think of games such as Asteroids, Elite or Vib-Ribbon. 

- **Simple Shapes**: This aesthetic will be combined with big, bold shapes and represented in more colours. These will represent planets, asteroids and points of interest in the game.

I've chosen this style because I was inspired by the unique visual style and aesthetic of the game Vib-Ribbon. It's simple and crude but I find it interesting how you can still demonstrate imagery in a format like that.

It is a callback to some of the earlist video games that used displays that could only draw lines.
